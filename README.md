# View-Semantic Fisher Contrastive Learning for View-Invariant Skeleton-based Action Recognition(VS-FCL)

This code is part of the paper: *View-Semantic Fisher Contrastive Learning for View-Invariant Skeleton-based Action Recognition*
***
The view change is a serious challenge for extracting invariant representation for action analysis due to occlusion and deformation. To address this problem, we propose a View-Semantic Fisher Contrastive Learning (VS-FCL) for view-invariant action representation and recognition. The VS-FCL consists of two components, View-term Fisher Contrastive Learning (V-FCL) and Semantic-term Fisher Contrastive Learning (S-FCL), where V-FCL propels view disentanglement for obtaining view-invariant action representation and S-FCL drives the semantic disentanglement to seek effective semantic-oriented representation for accurate action
recognition. Besides, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Cross-View Representation (ST-CVR) learning to capture view-interactive action features to fuse action information from different views, so as to guarantee obtaining view-invariant representation and improving recognition accuracy. Extensive and fair
evaluations are conducted on the UESTC, NTU 60, NTU 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets. The experiment results show that our proposed approach achieves outstanding performance on all datasets for view-invariant action recognition.
